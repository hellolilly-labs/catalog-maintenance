# Voice Assistant RAG Integration - Follow-up Tasks

## Status: Integration Complete ✅

We've successfully integrated the advanced RAG solution from catalog-maintenance into the LiveKit Voice Assistant. This note captures the current state and remaining tasks for when we return after working on Pinecone upserts.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Enhanced Search Integration ✅
- **`search_service.py`** - Added three new methods:
  - `enhance_product_query_with_filters()` - Extracts brand-specific filters from queries
  - `search_products_rag_with_filters()` - RAG search with intelligent filtering
  - `search_knowledge_rag_with_context()` - Context-aware knowledge search
- Integrated QueryOptimizationAgent with 30-50 message conversation context
- Added Langfuse support for dynamic prompt management
- Graceful fallback when enhanced components aren't available

### 2. Assistant Methods Updated ✅
- **`sample_assistant.py`**:
  - `product_search()` - Now uses enhanced query optimization and filter extraction
  - `knowledge_search()` - Now uses context-aware search
- Both methods maintain backward compatibility

### 3. Account Manager Cleanup ✅
- Simplified `get_rag_details()` to only return index name (not embedding model)
- Standardized embedding model to "llama-text-embed-v2" across the platform
- Updated all callers to handle the new return type

### 4. Code Cleanup ✅
- Removed outdated files:
  - `VOICE_ASSISTANT_RAG_INTEGRATION.md` (outdated guide)
  - `enhanced_search_service.py` (unused)
  - `sample_assistant_enhanced.py` (unused)
- Fixed all unused variable warnings with `_` prefix

### 5. Documentation & Testing ✅
- Created `VOICE_ASSISTANT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_FOR_CLAUDE.md` - Current implementation guide
- Created `test_search_service.py` - Comprehensive test harness

## Tasks for After Pinecone Upserts

### 1. Verify Integration with Real Data
Once product catalogs and knowledge bases are upserted:
- [ ] Test filter extraction with actual catalog data
- [ ] Verify RAG search returns enhanced product descriptors
- [ ] Check filter matching accuracy
- [ ] Test knowledge search with real documentation

### 2. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement query optimizer pre-warming (code stub already exists)
- [ ] Add caching for frequently used filters
- [ ] Monitor search latency with real indexes
- [ ] Optimize conversation context lookback (currently 30-50 messages)

### 3. Langfuse Prompt Configuration
- [ ] Create prompts in Langfuse:
  ```
  liddy/catalog/{account}/product_query_enhancement
  liddy/catalog/{account}/knowledge_query_enhancement
  ```
- [ ] Test dynamic prompt updates without code changes
- [ ] Configure account-specific prompt variations

### 4. Missing Component Integration
The following components from catalog-maintenance need to be copied over:
- [ ] `src/agents/query_optimization_agent.py`
- [ ] `src/agents/catalog_filter_analyzer.py`
- [ ] `src/catalog/enhanced_descriptor_generator.py`
- [ ] `src/prompts/system_prompt_builder.py`

### 5. Additional Enhancements
- [ ] Add Result Quality Agent (mentioned in todos)
- [ ] Implement filter effectiveness tracking
- [ ] Add A/B testing framework for enhanced vs. basic search
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard for search quality metrics

### 6. Clean Up Remaining Warnings
- [ ] Fix remaining import warnings (these are expected in catalog-maintenance environment)
- [ ] Update test harness imports for the target environment

## Key Integration Points

### QueryOptimizationAgent Integration
```python
# Current implementation in search_service.py
enhanced_query, extracted_filters = await SearchService.enhance_product_query_with_filters(
    query=query,
    user_state=self.session.userdata,
    chat_ctx=self.chat_ctx,  # Uses 30-50 messages
    account=self._account,
    product_knowledge=self._prompt_manager.product_search_knowledge or ""
)
```

### Filter Format Example
```json
{
  "category": "road",
  "frame_material": "carbon",
  "price": [0, 3000],
  "intended_use": ["racing"],
  "features": ["electronic_shifting", "disc_brakes"]
}
```

### Pinecone Filter Conversion
The system automatically converts extracted filters to Pinecone query format:
- Price ranges → `{"price": {"$gte": 0, "$lte": 3000}}`
- Multi-select → `{"features": {"$in": ["electronic_shifting"]}}`
- Categories → `{"category": "road"}`

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_search_service.py --test all --account specialized.com

# Test specific functionality
python test_search_service.py --test query_enhancement
python test_search_service.py --test product_search
python test_search_service.py --test knowledge_search
python test_search_service.py --test performance
```

## Notes

1. **Embedding Model**: Now standardized to "llama-text-embed-v2" (2048 dimensions)
2. **Context Window**: Currently using 30-50 messages for query understanding
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System works without enhanced components
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Query optimizers cached per account for efficiency

## Questions to Address

1. Should we increase the conversation context window beyond 50 messages?
2. Do we need account-specific embedding models in the future?
3. Should filter extraction be synchronous or can we pre-compute common patterns?
4. How should we handle filter conflicts (e.g., user says "cheap" but also "high-end")?

When we return from Pinecone work, start here to complete the integration and verify everything works with real data.
