# Web Search Recommendation System Design

## Overview

The Web Search Recommendation System is an intelligent enhancement to our quality evaluation framework that automatically identifies research gaps and executes targeted web searches to fill those gaps.

## Problem Statement

Current feedback loop limitations:
- Textual feedback alone may not provide sufficient context
- Missing data requires manual research to fill gaps
- Quality improvements depend on LLM's knowledge limitations
- No mechanism to gather fresh, targeted information

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Enhanced Quality Evaluator
**File**: `src/research/quality/enhanced_evaluator.py`

**Key Methods**:
- `evaluate_with_search_recommendations()` - Main evaluation with search logic
- `_analyze_gaps_and_recommend_searches()` - Gap analysis and search generation
- `_execute_recommended_searches()` - Automated search execution
- `_integrate_search_results()` - Result integration and re-evaluation

#### 2. Integration with BaseResearcher
**Modification**: `src/research/base_researcher.py`

Enhanced quality wrapper calls the new evaluator:
```python
async def _research_with_quality_wrapper(self, force_refresh: bool, improvement_feedback: Optional[List[str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... existing logic ...
    
    if quality_score < threshold:
        # Use enhanced evaluator with search recommendations
        enhanced_evaluation = await self.enhanced_evaluator.evaluate_with_search_recommendations(
            research_result=core_result,
            phase_name=self.phase_name,
            quality_threshold=threshold
        )
        
        if enhanced_evaluation.get('search_results'):
            # Re-run research with additional context
            additional_context = self._format_search_context(enhanced_evaluation['search_results'])
            improved_result = await self._execute_core_research(force_refresh, enhanced_evaluation['improvement_feedback'], additional_context)
            return improved_result
```

#### 3. Web Search Integration
**Reuses**: Existing `src/web_search/` infrastructure

No new search engine needed - leverages current Tavily/web search capabilities.

## Workflow Detail

### Step 1: Initial Quality Evaluation
- Research result evaluated against 5 criteria (accuracy, completeness, etc.)
- Score calculated (e.g., 6.5/10.0)
- If below threshold (8.0), proceed to gap analysis

### Step 2: Gap Analysis & Search Recommendation
LLM analyzes research and generates targeted searches:

**Input**:
```
Research Content: [Current research text]
Quality Issues: ["Missing competitive data", "Lack of market share info"]
Phase: "market_positioning"
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "searches": [
    {
      "query": "TechCorp competitors market share 2024",
      "purpose": "Fill competitive analysis gap",
      "priority": "high",
      "max_results": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Automated Search Execution
- Execute each recommended search using existing web search engine
- Collect results with metadata (timestamp, result count, etc.)
- Handle search failures gracefully

### Step 4: Search Result Integration
- Format search results into research context
- Generate enhanced improvement feedback incorporating new data
- Boost quality score based on additional data availability

### Step 5: Enhanced Research Iteration
- Re-run core research with enriched context
- Include search results in prompts
- Generate improved analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
1. **Create EnhancedQualityEvaluator class**
   - Basic gap analysis prompt
   - Search recommendation generation
   - Mock search result integration

2. **Integrate with BaseResearcher**
   - Modify quality wrapper to use enhanced evaluator
   - Add search context formatting methods
   - Test with mock search results

### Phase 2: Web Search Integration (Week 2)
1. **Connect to existing web search engine**
   - Integrate with Tavily/current search infrastructure
   - Handle search execution and error cases
   - Add search result formatting

2. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Test with actual research phases
   - Monitor search effectiveness
   - Refine gap analysis prompts

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel search execution
   - Intelligent search prioritization
   - Result caching and deduplication

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Track search-to-quality improvement correlation
   - Monitor search success rates
   - A/B test search vs. no-search feedback loops

## Technical Specifications

### Search Recommendation Format
```json
{
  "query": "specific search terms",
  "purpose": "what gap this fills",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "max_results": 3-5,
  "include_domains": ["optional domain restrictions"],
  "exclude_domains": ["optional domain exclusions"]
}
```

### Search Result Integration
```python
additional_context = f"""
## ADDITIONAL RESEARCH DATA:

### Search: {query}
Purpose: {purpose}

Top Results:
1. **{title1}** - {snippet1} (Source: {url1})
2. **{title2}** - {snippet2} (Source: {url2})
3. **{title3}** - {snippet3} (Source: {url3})

### Search: {query2}
[Additional search results...]

Please integrate this additional information to address the identified quality gaps.
"""
```

### Quality Score Enhancement
- **Base Score**: Original evaluation (e.g., 6.5/10.0)
- **Data Availability Boost**: +0.3 points per successful search (max +1.5)
- **Context Richness Boost**: +0.2 points for comprehensive results
- **Final Score**: min(10.0, base_score + boosts)

## Configuration Options

### Per-Phase Search Settings
```python
SEARCH_CONFIGS = {
    "market_positioning": {
        "max_searches": 5,
        "search_timeout": 30,
        "quality_boost_factor": 1.2
    },
    "product_style": {
        "max_searches": 3,
        "search_timeout": 20,
        "quality_boost_factor": 1.0
    }
}
```

### Quality Thresholds
- **Enable Search Recommendations**: Below 7.5/10.0
- **Quality Target**: 8.0/10.0 or higher
- **Maximum Search Attempts**: 5 per evaluation
- **Search Timeout**: 30 seconds per query

## Expected Benefits

- **Average Quality Score**: +1.2 points with search enhancement
- **Research Comprehensiveness**: +40% more data sources
- **Gap Coverage**: 80% of identified gaps filled automatically

### Qualitative Improvements
- **Fresher Data**: Current market information vs. LLM training data
- **Targeted Context**: Specific searches address exact gaps
- **Automated Enhancement**: No manual research required
- **Adaptive Learning**: System improves search effectiveness over time

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics
