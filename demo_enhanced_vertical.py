Enhanced Brand Vertical Detection Demo - Addressing User Feedback

USER FEEDBACK ADDRESSED:
1. ‚úÖ Strategic product sampling (no more random sampling misses)
2. ‚úÖ Direct web search questions ("what is the primary vertical...")
3. ‚úÖ Paper trail pattern (confidence, reasoning, evidence) across entire stack

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS:
- Strategic category-weighted sampling to avoid missing core products
- Direct vertical questions to search engines
- AI decision tracking with complete transparency
- Standardized paper trail pattern for all AI decisions
