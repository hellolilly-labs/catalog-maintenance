## Title
feat: Implement comprehensive price-based search with terminology research

## Labels

- voice-assistant
- catalog-maintenance

## Description

### Summary
Implemented a complete price-aware search system that enables natural language price queries, understands industry terminology, and provides contextual price information in voice assistant responses.

### Problem
Previously, the system had limited support for price-based queries:
- No understanding of natural language price expressions ("under $500", "affordable")
- Missing industry-specific terminology (e.g., "S-Works" = premium)
- Voice assistant couldn't provide price context in responses
- No semantic understanding of price tiers

### Solution
Created an integrated system with:

1. **Industry Terminology Research**
   - Automated research of brand-specific price terminology
   - Classification system for appropriate AI usage
   - Integration with descriptor generation

2. **Price Statistics Analysis**
   - Multi-modal distribution detection
   - Category-specific price analysis
   - Dynamic tier determination

3. **Enhanced Search**
   - Natural language price query parsing
   - Price range filtering
   - Fuzzy matching for price expressions

4. **Voice Assistant Integration**
   - Price context in summaries
   - Understanding of price-related questions
   - Natural responses using industry terminology

### Implementation Details

#### New Components
- `IndustryTerminologyResearcher`: Researches and classifies industry terms
- `PriceStatisticsAnalyzer`: Analyzes catalog pricing patterns
- `PriceDescriptorUpdater`: Enhances descriptors with price context

#### Enhanced Components
- `SearchService`: Added price extraction and filtering
- `VoiceSearchWrapper`: Integrated price context in responses
- `UnifiedDescriptorGenerator`: Integrated with terminology research

#### Runner Scripts
- `run/research_industry_terminology.py`
- `run/analyze_price_distribution.py`
- `run/update_descriptor_prices.py`
- `run/test_price_enhancement.py`

#### Automation Scripts
- `scripts/ensure_research_before_descriptors.sh`
- `scripts/update_descriptors_with_research.sh`

### Testing
```bash
# Test complete workflow
./scripts/ensure_research_before_descriptors.sh specialized.com

# Test price queries
python run/test_price_enhancement.py specialized.com
```

### Examples

#### Supported Queries
- "Show me bikes under $500"
- "What's in the premium range?"
- "Find me something affordable"
- "Any road bikes on sale?"

#### Voice Assistant Response
```
I found 3 bikes that match your budget:
1. Rockhopper - $450-$550 - This entry-level mountain bike offers...
2. Sirrus - $500-$600 - Currently on sale for $499 (save 17%)...
3. Roll - $400-$500 - This value-focused option makes quality accessible...
```

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive.

### Migration Guide
For existing brands:
1. Run terminology research: `python run/research_industry_terminology.py [brand]`
2. Update descriptors: `python run/update_descriptor_prices.py [brand]`
3. Regenerate if needed: `python run/generate_descriptors.py [brand]`

### Notes
The content classification system allows the AI to understand all customer language while maintaining professional standards. This is especially important for brands in sensitive industries (e.g., sexual health) where understanding terminology is critical for effective communication.
