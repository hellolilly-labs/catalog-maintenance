# Research Storage Migration - Fix Complete âœ…

The research storage migration has been successfully fixed. All research files are now in the correct new structure.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Base Researcher Path Update**: The `_load_cached_results()` method in `base_researcher.py` was using the old path structure and has been updated.

2. **Product Catalog Research**: The product catalog research files are now correctly loading from the new structure:
   - Old: `accounts/{brand}/research_phases/{phase}_research.md`
   - New: `accounts/{brand}/research/{phase}/research.md`

3. **Import Updates**: Updated imports in the old src/ files to point to the new packages structure.

## Verification Results

Running the verification script shows:
- âœ… All 9 research phases are in the new location
- âœ… ProductCatalogResearcher successfully loads cached results
- âœ… UnifiedDescriptorGenerator successfully loads product catalog intelligence

## How to Run Ingestion

Use the runner scripts which have the correct imports:

```bash
# Run catalog ingestion
python run/ingest_catalog.py specialized.com

# Or with options
python run/ingest_catalog.py specialized.com --preview
python run/ingest_catalog.py specialized.com --force-update
```

## Important Notes

1. **Don't use old scripts**: The scripts in `src/` have been updated to redirect to the new packages, but it's better to use the runner scripts in `run/` directory.

2. **Package structure**: All code is now organized in:
   - `packages/liddy/` - Core functionality
   - `packages/liddy_intelligence/` - Brand research & catalog
   - `packages/liddy_voice/` - Voice assistant

3. **Research phases available**: foundation, market_positioning, product_style, brand_style, customer_cultural, voice_messaging, interview_synthesis, linearity_analysis, product_catalog

The fix is complete and the system is ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
