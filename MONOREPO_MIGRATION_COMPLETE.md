## New Structure

```
catalog-maintenance/
├── packages/
│   ├── liddy/              # Core shared functionality
│   ├── liddy_intelligence/ # Brand research & catalog
│   └── liddy_voice/        # Voice assistant
├── run/                    # CLI runner scripts

└── src/                   # Legacy redirects
```

## Key Changes

### Import Pattern Updates
- Cross-package: `from liddy.storage import get_account_storage_provider`
- Within package: `from ..research.base_researcher import BaseResearcher`
- Runner scripts: Add packages to path

### Configuration Centralization
- Created `liddy.config` module
- Replaced all `configs.settings` imports
- Centralized environment variable handling

### Research Storage Migration
- Old: `research_phases/<phase>_research.md`
- New: `research/<phase>/research.md`
- Automatic migration handled

## Development Guidelines

1. **New Features**: Add to appropriate package
2. **Imports**: Follow established patterns
3. **Testing**: Add tests in package-specific test directories
4. **Documentation**: Update package READMEs

## Backward Compatibility

Old imports in `src/` redirect to new locations:
- Minimal disruption to existing code
- Clear migration messages
- Gradual transition path

## Next Steps

1. Remove src/ directory when all dependencies updated
2. Update CI/CD for monorepo structure
3. Consider package versioning strategy
4. Update deployment documentation

## Migration Complete ✅

All functionality preserved and improved with cleaner organization.
