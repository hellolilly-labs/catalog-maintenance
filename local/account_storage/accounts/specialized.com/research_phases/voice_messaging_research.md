1. BRAND VOICE CHARACTERISTICS  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Core voice attributes distilled from >1,200 SKU descriptions, executive quotes and site copy.

Tone & Personality  
• Expert-Athlete Mentor – speaks with authority yet remains “one of the riders.” Never aloof, never gimmicky.  
• Optimistically Technical – hard data is delivered with enthusiasm (“Pertex® Quantum Air + Polartec® Alpha keep you warm while you hammer” [Product Style 1]).  
• Competitive but Inclusive – celebrates marginal gains for racers AND everyday commuters (“improve riders’ lives” corporate line [Mission 13]).  

Communication Style  
• Rider-First Directness – leads with the problem solved, then the proof (“Ground Control Positioning lets you put a foot down without dismounting” [Product Style 3]).  
• Educational Storytelling – historic firsts (“first mass-produced mountain bike” [History 1,2]) and lab tech (“Body Geometry saddles”) are woven into mini-lessons.  
• Inspirational Undercurrent – taglines “Pedal the Planet Forward” and “Innovate and inspire” inject purpose beyond speed [Mission 13; Leadership 2].

Vocabulary & Language Patterns  
• Key lexical set: “Rider-First,” “S-Works,” “Epic,” “Body Geometry,” “marginal gains,” “stiffness-to-weight,” “factory race tuned.”  
• Sentence construction: short, active verbs; technical nouns; infrequent adjectives unless performance-oriented (“hyper-responsive,” “wind-cheating”).  
• Constant “you”/“we” parity – demonstrates partnership (“We tested. You win.”).

Emotional Resonance  
• Pride in Progress – customers feel they’re part of cycling history and innovation lineage (“since 1974” heritage stamp [History 1]).  
• Empowerment – language frames equipment as unlock (“Roll lets you put a foot down…” = confidence for new riders [Product Style 3]).  
• Community – “riders” unifies racers, commuters, parents; avoids elitist “cyclists.”

2. MESSAGING ARCHITECTURE & STRATEGY  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
A. Core Value Propositions  
1. Proven Performance Innovation – first to market mountain, carbon & rider-contact tech [History 1-3].  
2. Rider-First Engineering – every touch-point designed from the saddle outward (Body Geometry ecosystem) [Product Style 5].  
3. Purpose With Planet – “Pedal the Planet Forward” signals sustainability & active transport mission [Mission 13].  
4. Lifetime Community Support – global 36-office reach, advocacy & service [History 11].

B. Brand Positioning Statements / Taglines  
Master: “Innovate and inspire to improve riders’ lives.” [Mission 13]  
Purpose: “Pedal the Planet Forward.” [Leadership 2]  
Product-grade: “Made for riders, by riders.” (site header, observed)  

C. Product Messaging Hierarchy  
1. Halo: S-Works – bleeding-edge R&D, race-team validated.  
2. Performance: Pro / Expert – nearly S-Works performance, accessible price.  
3. Enthusiast: Comp / Base – reliability, everyday speed.  
4. Equipment & Gear – Body Geometry contact points, apparel, parts.  
Lead with innovation proof (tech spec), back-load lifestyle benefit (“faster up, safer down”).  

D. Competitive Differentiation  
• “We did it first” heritage (Stumpjumper, Epic carbon) [History 1-3].  
• In-house ergonomic science (Body Geometry) [Product Style 5].  
• Balance of breadth (1,225 SKUs) and depth (race-proven tech) absent in most rivals [Catalog 1].

3. TARGET AUDIENCE COMMUNICATION  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Core Segments & Preferred Messaging Patterns  
1. Performance Enthusiasts (25-45, $120k+ HHI) – accept deeper jargon, crave wattage, stiffness metrics.  
2. Fitness/Commuters (25-45, $75-120k HHI) – want tangible everyday benefits (comfort, safety, maintenance ease).  
3. Budget/Casual & Parents (18-25 students; 35-55 family) – respond to problem/solution framing & value reassurance (56 % of catalog ≤$100 [Customer 1]).

Technical vs. Accessible Balance  
• 70/30 rule: headline benefit in plain English, sub-copy may descend into NERD-mode.  
  Example: “Warm when you need it, cool when you charge (thanks to Polartec® Alpha insulation).”  

Performance vs. Lifestyle Messaging  
• Site currently skews ≈114:1 toward performance SKU descriptors [Customer 2].  
• Recommend sidebar or blog series translating race tech into daily-ride wins to court lifestyle buyers.

Cultural Sensitivity & Inclusivity  
• Consistent use of gender-neutral “rider.”  
• Visuals show broad age & ethnicity range; messaging should echo (“Whether it’s your first commute or your 100th race…”).  
• Avoid jargon not easily globalised; include metric/imperial dual units for 36-country footprint [History 11].

4. CHANNEL & CONTEXT ADAPTATION  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Website / e-Com  
• Format: Problem → Tech Proof → Ride Benefit → Specs table.  
• Tone: confident, efficient, bullet-heavy, embedded video demos.

Product Descriptions  
• Maintain 120-word max hero paragraph, 5-bullet tech proofs, “Why You’ll Love It” closing line.  
• Always cite proprietary tech and test data where available.

Marketing Campaigns / Advertising  
• Narrative + Outcome: film/podcasts featuring founder story, race victories, commuter case studies.  
• Tone dial: 60 % inspirational, 40 % technical.

Social Media  
• Instagram/TikTok: punchy captions, emojis allowed with moderation; product snags show before/after weight or speed.  
• LinkedIn: innovation deep dives, CEO sustainability pledges; drop emojis altogether.

Customer Service / Support  
• Voice identical to website but with empathy lead: “We get how frustrating a squeak can be—let’s silence it together.”  
• Macro scripts include plain-language translation of tech terms.

5. MESSAGING THEMES & CONTENT PILLARS  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
1. Relentless Innovation – lab footage, patent highlights, R&D stories.  
2. Performance Validated – race wins, athlete testimonials, wind-tunnel data.  
3. Rider Experience – comfort science, fit clinics, Body Geometry explainer series.  
4. Heritage & Authority – 1974 garage origin, Stumpjumper firsts.  
5. Sustainability & Community – “Pedal the Planet Forward,” recycling programs, trail stewardship days.

Each content asset should visibly ladder up to at least one pillar; use tags to audit mix.

6. VOICE GUIDELINES & IMPLEMENTATION  
──────────────────────────────────────────────  
Do’s  
✓ Lead with rider benefit, follow with tech evidence.  
✓ Speak like an expert-teammate, not a detached lab coat.  
✓ Use the sanctioned lexicon (Rider-First, Body Geometry, S-Works, Aero is Everything).  
✓ Cite testing miles, grams saved, or rider stories whenever possible.

Don’ts  
✗ Over-inflate claims (“fastest ever built” must be referenced).  
✗ Default to bike-shop jargon without translation.  
✗ Talk down to novices or over-praise pros.  
✗ Dilute heritage references by omitting dates or context.

Tone Variations  
• “Launch Hype” (campaign, social teaser): 8-10 excitement score, emojis optional.  
• “Spec Sheet” (product page): 5-6, no emojis, precise units.  
• “Service Ticket” (support): 6-7 warmth, empathetic intro.  
• “Corporate ESG” (press/LinkedIn): 4-5 measured, data-driven.

Messaging Approval Checklist  
1. Benefit first, proof second.  
2. Uses approved lexicon & pillars.  
3. Reads aloud in <60 seconds (web copy).  
4. Inclusivity pass – no gendered or elitist phrasing.  
5. Fact-check citations (wind-tunnel data, race wins).

Voice Evolution Strategy  
• Annual “Rider Panel” language audit – invite 3 key segments to score clarity & inspiration.  
• Add sustainability vocabulary depth in 2024-25 (e.g., “circularity,” “re-ride materials”) as Pedal the Planet Forward ramps.  
• Localisation playbook for non-US offices: glossary + sample translations of tech terms.
